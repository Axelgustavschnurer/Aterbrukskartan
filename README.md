# STUNS maps

This project is a rewrite of a previous map project (available in the `StunsStreetMap_Archive` branch) aiming to display stories where STUNS has been involved with students from Uppsala's universities regarding their projects.

This project also contains a secondary hidden map as a demo for a project that aims to facilitate recycling of construction materials by displaying planned projects.
The idea is that companies enter some project information, like when and where they will do what, and what kinds of materials they will need or have available.

# Dev stuff

**Because of how it is written, this project won't work if certain columns in the database are empty. This includes when the entire database is empty.**

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is used for the frontend and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used for the database.


To view our plans for possible future improvements, see [this document](https://stuns.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/terbrukskartan/ET3yGNnQiTNPra6jFuFIEygB-gpCZnkSEF_R-C6VWvCt6w?e=htn8uE).

## Getting Started

All commands are to be run in your terminal of choice, in the root directory of the project.

First, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and clone the repository here on Azure (preferably to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) regardless of what you use).

Thereafter, install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory containing the following:

```
DATABASE_URL = "sqlserver://<url>:<port>;database=<database>;user=<user>;pwd=<password>;<optional arguments>"

SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://localhost:1433;database=shadow;trustServerCertificate=true;integratedSecurity=true"
```

The current database url is already set up in a .env file among the secure files on azure, so if you change database you need to update the file there as well.

If you don't know the database url, try asking a project admin.
If they don't know or can't be reached, you could try contacting leon.loov@outlook.com.

If you still can't get the database url, you could theoretically get the deployment pipeline to print it out, but that's extremely bad practice and absolutely not recommended.

- Do note that the database url is a secret and should not be shared with anyone.
  - Making the pipeline print it out is a very bad idea because it will be visible to others in the logs.
- If you still want to do it, you should google how to print environment variables in Azure Pipelines. It's not hard, but it's not something I'm going to write here.

The shadow database url doesn't _need_ to be on localhost, however it shouldn't match the actual database url.

- The shadow database is used as an intermediary step when changing the database schema, and data should not be stored there.
- To create a local database, you can use [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (SSMS).

Run prisma generate to generate the prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (by default) to see the site. *Note that it won't work if the database is empty, see the note at the top of this file.*

To view the database, run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Then open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) to see the data.

## Changing the database schema

NOTE: The following instructions are NOT best practice, we are using a dev command to change the production database schema. MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD A BACKUP OF THE DATABASE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. Either go [here](https://maps.stuns.se/download) while logged in and download Stories-data, mapItem-data, and Recycle-data, or get a proper backup somehow. Be careful when restoring/creating a new database from your choice of backup as well, as it might give new IDs to existing data and thus break links between tables. (The recommended tool for data import, the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, might mess up the IDs by default, and we don't seem to have the permissions necessary to get actual backups from the database or copy it using the Copy Database Wizard.)

In order to change the database schema, make sure you have a shadow database url set up in your `.env` file.

Edit the file at `prisma/schema.prisma` to change the database schema.

Then, run the following command to make sure the database is valid:

```bash
npx prisma validate
```

If the database is valid, you can run the following command to create a migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

and follow the instructions.

Otherwise, figure out a way to fix the database.

## Important links

If running on localhost, replace `maps.stuns.se` with `localhost:3000` in the links below.

- [https://maps.stuns.se](https://maps.stuns.se) - Stories map.
- [https://maps.stuns.se/?energiportalen=true](https://maps.stuns.se/?energiportalen=true) - Customized version of the Stories map, to be viewed from within the iframes of Energiportalen.
- [https://maps.stuns.se/aterbruk](https://maps.stuns.se/aterbruk) - Ã…terbrukskartan.
- [https://maps.stuns.se/download](https://maps.stuns.se/download) - Page where you can download data from the database, both in current format and the old format used at dataportalen.

### Uploading data to the database

If you want to upload recycle data to the database, you should run the project locally and use the button that shows up on the download page when logged in as an admin.  
Link to default localhost location: [http://localhost:3000/download](http://localhost:3000/download)  
There is a folder called externalData in the root directory of the project wherein you can find some example files from the first upload.  
The file called `ByggaBo.geojson` is used to convert from "Fastighetsbeteckning" to coordinates, and should not be changed unless you know what you're doing and are feeling up to the task of changing the code that uses it.  
The file called `skolfastigheter.csv` contains an example of data that can be uploaded to the database. Any file you wish to upload should be in the same format (converted from the xlsx file provided by the municipality to a csv file with utf-8 encoding). You can change the file name, but make sure to change the name in the code as well. The file name is currently set to `skolfastigheter.csv` in `src\pages\api\addRecycleFromExternal.ts` on line 64 (in the declaration of the variable `csvFile`). If you feel up for it, feel free to update the code to accept any file name or drag and drop functionality in the browser or whatever else to make it easier to upload data.

### Good to know

The project previously used query-embedded keys to restrict access to certain pages, but it is now replaced with a more secure system using iron-session. If you find a link like `https://maps.stuns.se/?stunsStoriesAdmin=hVg1JHJV787gFGftrd` it is from an old version of the project and the query part of the link can be removed. The link will still work with it there, but it is unnecessary now. The only query parameter that is still used is `energiportalen=true` which is used to customize the map to be viewed within the iframes of Energiportalen.

We store a few different values in the iron-session cookie, which are as follows:
- id - the id of the user in the database.
- email - the email of the user.
- isLoggedIn - boolean, doesn't really do anything; any user with a valid session is currently assigned this role, but checks that only need the user to be logged in check for if the user has a valid session, not that they have this specific role.
- isAdmin - boolean, if true the user can access all pages, can add and edit users, can upload certain data to the database when running the project locally, can add and edit Stories and Recycle data and enter any organisation as owner of those projects.
- isStoryteller - boolean, if true the user can add and edit Stories, and enter any organisation as owner of those projects.
- isRecycler - boolean, if true the user can add and edit Recycle data related to the organisation/-s listed in their recycleOrganisations field and can enter those organisations as owner of those projects.
- recycleOrganisations - a list of organisations that the user is allowed to enter as owner of Recycle projects. This doesn't restrict access to any pages, but it restricts which organisations the user can enter as owner of Recycle projects. If the user is not an admin, they can only enter organisations that are in this list. If the user is an admin, they can enter any organisation as owner of Recycle projects, regardless of what is in this list.

## API Routes

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
